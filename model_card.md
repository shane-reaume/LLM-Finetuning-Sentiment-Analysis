# DistilBERT for Sentiment Analysis - IMDB Movie Reviews

This model is a fine-tuned version of [distilbert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased) on the [IMDB dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb), trained for sentiment analysis of movie reviews.

## Model Details

- **Developed by:** YOUR_NAME ([@YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_USERNAME](https://huggingface.co/YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_USERNAME))
- **Model type:** Fine-tuned DistilBERT
- **Language:** English
- **License:** MIT
- **Finetuned from:** [distilbert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased)

## Performance

Evaluation on a balanced test set of 100 examples (50 positive, 50 negative):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Accuracy | XX.XX% |
| F1 Score | X.XXXX |
| Precision | XX.XX% |
| Recall | XX.XX% |
| Inference Time | ~X.XX ms/example |

## Uses

### Direct Use

This model can be used directly for sentiment analysis of text, particularly movie reviews:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load the model
sentiment = pipeline("sentiment-analysis", model="YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_MODEL_NAME")

# Make predictions
result = sentiment("I really enjoyed this movie!")
print(result)
```

### Example Results

```
[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998}]  # For positive text
[{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9987}]  # For negative text
```

## Training Details

- **Dataset:** IMDB Movie Reviews dataset (25,000 training examples)
- **Base Model:** distilbert-base-uncased
- **Training Parameters:**
  - Learning rate: 2e-5
  - Batch size: 16
  - Epochs: 3
  - Optimizer: AdamW

## Limitations and Biases

This model was trained on movie reviews and may not perform as well on other types of text. It may also reflect biases present in the training data.
