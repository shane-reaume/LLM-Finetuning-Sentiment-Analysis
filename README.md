A comprehensive educational project demonstrating transformer-based NLP model fine-tuning with robust QA practices. This repository showcases supervised fine-tuning of DistilBERT for binary sentiment classification, implementing advanced testing methodologies including adversarial examples, edge case handling, and performance benchmarking‚Äîall designed for ML practitioners seeking to improve model reliability and evaluation techniques.

## üéØ What This Project Does

This project demonstrates how to:

- Fine-tune language models for sentiment classification
- Implement proper testing and evaluation methodologies for LLMs
- Create evaluation metrics and test sets for consistent model testing
- Deploy models to Hugging Face Hub as a Transformer model
  - original model: [huggingface.co/shane-reaume/imdb-sentiment-analysis](https://huggingface.co/shane-reaume/imdb-sentiment-analysis)
  - improved model: [huggingface.co/shane-reaume/imdb-sentiment-analysis-v2](https://huggingface.co/shane-reaume/imdb-sentiment-analysis-v2)
- Create interactive demos for testing models

## üìã System Requirements

- **Python 3.13 or higher**
- **Git** for version control
- **GPU with VRAM**:
  - 8GB+ recommended for sentiment analysis
  - CPU-only training is possible but very slow
- **Basic Python knowledge** (No ML experience required)
- **Platform Compatibility**:
  - ‚úÖ **Windows 11**: Using WSL with Ubuntu
  - ‚úÖ **Linux**: Confirmed on Debian-based distributions like Linux Mint and Ubuntu
  - ‚ùå **macOS**: Not currently compatible due to PyTorch version requirements
    - Project uses PyTorch 2.6.0, while macOS is limited to PyTorch 2.2.0
    - May work with modifications to `requirements.txt` but not officially supported

## üß™ Testing & Quality Assurance Focus

This project places special emphasis on testing methodologies for ML models. For a comprehensive guide to our testing approach, see [GETTING_STARTED.md#testing-philosophy-and-methodology](GETTING_STARTED.md#testing-philosophy-and-methodology).

### Test Types Implemented

- **Unit tests**: Testing individual components like data loaders
- **Functional tests**: Testing model predictions with known inputs
- **Performance tests**: Ensuring the model meets accuracy and speed requirements
- **Challenging test cases**: Specialized framework for testing difficult examples
- **Balanced test sets**: Creating test data with equal class distribution
- **High-confidence evaluations**: Analyzing model confidence in predictions
- **Memory tests**: Ensuring models can run on consumer hardware

### Testing Principles

- **Reproducibility**: Tests use fixed test sets to ensure consistent evaluation
- **Isolation**: Components are tested independently
- **Metrics tracking**: F1 score, precision, recall, and accuracy are tracked
- **Performance benchmarking**: Measuring inference speed and memory usage
- **Categorized challenges**: Tracking performance on specific types of difficult inputs

### Challenging Test Cases Framework

The project includes a specialized framework for testing model performance on particularly difficult examples:

- **Categorized test cases**: Organized by challenge type (subtle negative, sarcasm, negation, etc.)
- **Performance visualization**: Charts showing model accuracy by challenge category
- **Easy extension**: Tools to add new challenging cases as they're discovered
- **Detailed reporting**: JSON reports and summaries of model weaknesses

## üìä Example Results

After training the sentiment analysis model, you'll be able to classify text sentiment:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis", model="your-username/imdb-sentiment-analysis")
result = classifier("This movie was absolutely amazing, I loved every minute of it!")
print(result)  # [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998}]
```

## Next Steps

1. Follow the [Sentiment Analysis Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md)
2. Experiment with your own datasets and models
3. Contribute to the project by adding new test types or model architectures

```

## Troubleshooting

### Git Hooks Issues

If you encounter issues with the pre-commit hook preventing you from committing changes:

1. **Ensure your virtual environment is activated**:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Run tests manually** to see what's failing:

   ```bash
   ./run_tests.sh
   ```

3. **Use the force push script** to temporarily bypass hooks:

   ```bash
   ./force_push.sh
   ```

4. **Disable hooks temporarily** for a single commit:

   ```bash
   git commit --no-verify -m "Your commit message"
   ```

5. **Reinstall hooks** if they become corrupted:

   ```bash
   ./setup_hooks.sh
   ```
